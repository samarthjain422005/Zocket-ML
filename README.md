# Gemini Web Summarizer

A smart web content summarizer that:
- Scrapes and preprocesses a website's text.
- Chunks it intelligently with overlap.
- Embeds each chunk using **Sentence Transformers** and stores them in a **FAISS vector database**.
- Analyzes each chunk using **Gemini Pro** (Google Generative AI).
- Synthesizes a final coherent summary of the website.

Built in a single **Jupyter Notebook**.
